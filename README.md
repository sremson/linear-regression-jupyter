here's my assignment for class 2!


the purpose of this assignment was to be able to build a linear regression model in Jupyter and then convert those notebooks to scripts that can be run from the command line

i used the libraries ggplot, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib. i had a hard time understanding some of the errors and had to remind myself some of the basic commands but was able to ultimately get a good result.

for the R plot, the R squared is 0.7852. the python r squared is 0.7852, which is the same as the non adjusted R plot.

the hardest part of these assignments for me is getting github to work!! i swear it hates me. i always end up having to do something weird and then remembering i'm not actually in the folder when i'm in the terminal and that solves all my problems lol

okay i made the python and r scripts and then made them modifiable!!
this allows the script to be read and then the image can be generated to show the graph for each script.

this assignment has also reaffirmed to me just how touchy script is with being case sensitive! 

ASSIGNMENT 3
I'm adding this now to my assignment 3! I cloned my GitHub repo from Assignment 2 and am modifying it on a new branch. It contains all of my content from the previous assignment, now with updated and new files for this assignment!

I used the JupyterLab terminal to create a new branch, and I will be using Python and R to modify the regression code for the csv file used in the previous assignment.

The MSE for both python and R was 0.01, the y-intercept was 0.21, and the slope was 1.97. This MSE is very small which is great, it means our model prediction is not that far off from the actual values.

The new branch was created so we could alter the code and manipulate it without affecting the main code. Once it's correct, we can merge it back to the main branch.

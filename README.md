here's my assignment for class 2!


the purpose of this assignment was to be able to build a linear regression model in Jupyter and then convert those notebooks to scripts that can be run from the command line

i used the libraries ggplot, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib. i had a hard time understanding some of the errors and had to remind myself some of the basic commands but was able to ultimately get a good result.

for the R plot, the R squared is 0.7852. the python r squared is 0.7852, which is the same as the non adjusted R plot.

the hardest part of these assignments for me is getting github to work!! i swear it hates me. i always end up having to do something weird and then remembering i'm not actually in the folder when i'm in the terminal and that solves all my problems lol

okay i made the python and r scripts and then made them modifiable!!
this allows the script to be read and then the image can be generated to show the graph for each script.

this assignment has also reaffirmed to me just how touchy script is with being case sensitive!

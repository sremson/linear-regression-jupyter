here's my assignment for class 2!


the purpose of this assignment was to be able to build a linear regression model in Jupyter and then convert those notebooks to scripts that can be run from the command line

i used the libraries ggplot, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib. i had a hard time understanding some of the errors and had to remind myself some of the basic commands but was able to ultimately get a good result.

for the R plot, the R squared is 0.7852. the python r squared is 0.7852, which is the same as the non adjusted R plot.

the hardest part of these assignments for me is getting github to work!! i swear it hates me
